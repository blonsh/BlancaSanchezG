## About Me:
Junior QA Engineer transitioning from the world of Business Administration. Today I don't write financial reports, I write bug reports (and with more enthusiasm). 
⚡ My superpower is detecting errors before the client notices them and of course... ☕ making the best coffee to go with every test.
